                  <h2>SkyBlueCanvas Lightweight CMS is Free Software!</h2><p>SkyBlueCanvas Lightweight <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>
 is an open source, free content management system written in php and 
built specifically for small web sites. The entire site you are viewing 
is a demonstration of the SkyBlueCanvas lightweight CMS. SkyBlueCanvas 
is custom-built for those instances when more robust systems like 
Joomla, WordPress and Drupal are too much horsepower.</p><p>SkyBlueCanvas
 makes it very easy to keep the content of your site fresh without 
having to learn a lot of complicated features, templating systems or 
configuration. You simply upload the software to your web server, and 
you are ready to start adding text and pictures to your web site.</p><p>Lightweight
 and simple does not mean simplistic, however. SkyBlueCanvas includes a 
lot of the same basic abilities as more robust systems but in a simpler 
form. The software is not meant to be all things to all users but it 
does offer features you expect like a familiar <a href="http://blog.skybluecanvas.com/skybluecanvas-lightweight-cms/skybluecanvas-example/" title="Blog entry about SkyBlueCanvas Plugins" rel="bookmark">Plugin
