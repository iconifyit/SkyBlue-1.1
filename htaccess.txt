# The rules below are what enable the pretty URLs
#
#     Example: www.mysite.com/my-pretty-url
#
# These rules require that you have mod_rewrite installed and enabled 
# in your Apache web server, and that directory-level over-rides be enabled.
# Follow these instructions to enable both:
#
# 1. Find your Apache config file (httpd.conf) in /etc/httpd/ (Linux only)
# 2. Make a backup of this file (in case you make a mistake)
# 3. Find the line that reads 'LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so'
# 4. If there is a # sign in front of this line, it means it is disabled. Delete the # sign and save the file.
#   
#  Enable directory-level over-rides
#  
# 1. In the same httpd.conf file, find the section that looks something like this:
#    
# 	<Directory "/var/www/">
# 		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
# 		AllowOverride All <-- Make sure this is set to 'All'
# 		Order allow,deny
# 		Allow from all
# 	</Directory>
# 	
# 2. Make sure the AllowOverride option is set to "All".
# 3. Save the file
# 4. Restart Apache. On most Linux/Unix servers you open a command shell and type 'apachectl restart'

RewriteEngine on

# For most installations, the RewriteRules below should work fine.
# However, in some cases, you may experience behavior where the home 
# page is displayed no matter which link you click. If this is the behavior
# you are experiencing, try removing the '#' before the next line:

# RewriteBase /
