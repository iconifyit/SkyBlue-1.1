There are two ways you can load the fragment in a page:

News-specific skin:

- Create a new skin named skin.news.html
- Add the following code to the region of the page where the news are to appear:

<!--#plugin:fragments(news,view)-->

- Add a new page and set the Page Type to 'news'


In-Text Method:

- Create a new page in Admin > Pages and set the page type to your standard page type
- Add the following code to the body of the text using the WYSIWYG editor in the Page Manager

{plugin:fragment(news,view)}

NOTE:

Because the News fragment uses a preview to a link structure, you cannot place this fragment 
on a page with any other multi-level content item (for instance, the portfolio fragment).
