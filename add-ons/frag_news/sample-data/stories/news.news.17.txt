<p>The NoFollow Plugin assists with your search engine optimization by automatically adding the rel="nofollow" attribute to all outbound links on each page. You don't need to worry about adding the attribute - they are added just before the page is displayed. You will first need to set the "Site URL" value in Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Default Info. The plugin uses this value to determine whether or not a link is outbound or internal. Internal absolute and relative URLs are left untouched.</p>
