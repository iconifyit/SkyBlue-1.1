Installing Portfolio Extension for SkyBlueCanvas v1.1 RC1

It was brought to my attention today by a SkyBlueCanvas user that I neglected to include good instructions for installing the Portfolio and Galleria extensions. I apologize for the inconvenience. My excuse is that developing and delivering an open source project is a lot of work and all too often, the documentation is the last thing to get attention. We are working on correcting this problem.

In the mean time, here are some detailed instructions on how to install the Galleria Extension. The same instructions, with some very minor differences, also apply for the Portfolio Fragment (frag_portfolio).

This will look a bit daunting at first glance, but it is really not difficult. I have full confidence in anyone’s ability to install the extension. If you do as I ask you to, step-by-step, you will have the extension installed in no time.

Let’s get started
Here is how to set up the Portfolio extension, step-by-step:

   1. Copy /frag_portfolio/manager/portfolio/ to /your_skyblue_root/managers/

      If you already have the Portfolio Manager installed, you can skip this step.
      
   2. Go to /your_skyblue_root/data/skins/techjunkie/ and copy skin.text.html to your skin directory. Name the new file skin.portfolio.html.
      
      * Note *

      If you are using the techjunkie skin, just copy the skin.text.html file to the same directory.
      
   3. Leave this page as-is for now (we will come back to it)
   
   4. Go to Admin > Pages and create a new page and do the following:
          * Click the Meta Data tab
          * Give your page a name
          * Set the Page Type to ‘portfolio’
          * Fill in the other fields on the form as appropriate for your site
          * Click Save

Ok, this part is a bit tricky:

   1. Go to /your_skyblue_root/data/skins/your_skin/ and create a new directory named fragments
   
   2. Go to the frag_portfolio package you downloaded, and copy /frag_portfolio/fragments/portfolio to /your_skyblue_root/data/skins/your_skin/fragments/
   
   3. Go back to skin.portfolio.html and look for the line that reads:

      <!--#plugin:fragment(page,view)-->

      and change it to:

      <!--#plugin:fragment(portfolio,view)-->

   4. Go to Admin > Collections > Plugins and make sure the following plugins are enabled:
          * plugin.parser.php
          * plugin.fragments.php

Now all you need to do is add items to your portfolio in Admin > Collections > Gallery.
