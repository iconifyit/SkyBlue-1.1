First of all, my sincerest thanks to Codey Lindley (ThickBox), Jonathan Schemoul (SmoothGallery), and Leandro Vieira Pinho (LightBox), none of whom I know personally but who have all done the hard work to make the SkyBlueCanvas Gallery Pack possible. I just wrote a little bit of PHP and HTML.

Please visit their respective sites - better yet, donate some cash to them to help make sure they keep producing such great work.
