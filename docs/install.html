			<li>
			    <strong>PHP version 4 or 5</strong> running on Linux, Unix, FreeBSD, OpenBSD or MacOS X<br />
                (Sorry, Windows servers are not supported at this time)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>A FTP Client</strong>
                <p>
                You can get FileZilla from Mozilla for free at

                The <strong>Apache mod_rewrite module enabled</strong> (optional but recommended).
                <p>
                If you are unfamiliar with this module please consult with your hosting 
                company or system administrator.

            <li>

                <p>
                This library is used during the SkyBlueCanvas installation. If your installation of 
                PHP does not have it enabled, you can still install SkyBlueCanvas but you will have to 
                consult with your hosting provider to determine the correct file permissions to 
                set for the SkyBlueCanvas PHP files.
                </p>

                Download the SkyBlueCanvas ZIP or TAR file and extract the contents into a folder on your compter.

                <p>Connect to your web server using your FTP client and upload the SkyBlueCanvas code.</p>
                <p>Your hosting provider should have provided you with your FTP account address (URL), username and password. 
                Every FTP Client (software for connecting to a hosting account) is slightly different. Please consult the 
                documentation for your FTP Client software for connection instructions.

                    Change the file permissions of the entire skyblue folder to 775. 
                    Apply the changes recursively to all directories and files in the skyblue folder.

                <p>
                    SkyBlueCanvas will attempt to determine the correct file permissions.

                <p>
                    If your installation of PHP does not have the Posix Library enabled, set your file 
                    permissions to 777 in order to complete the SkyBlueCanvas installation. After the 
                    installation has completed, change your file permissions to 775.

                <p>
                    Every hosting provider has their servers set up slightly differently and there 
                    is no single set of permissions that apply for every hosting environment. Your 
                    best bet is to consult with your hosting provider's FAQs (frequently asked questions), 
                    user forums, or customer support.

            If you get an error when you point your browser to the Setup Wizard, try setting the 
            permissions of the /skyblue/ directory to 777. It is not recommended that you leave 
            the permissions set to 777. The first screen of the Setup Wizard will suggest the 
            proper settings. Once you have completed the installation, you can change the file 
            permissions to the correct setting. If you continue to have trouble, check your 
            hosting providerâ€™s documentation or contact their Support Center and ask for 
            "the correct settings for their server to allow web software to read and write files".
